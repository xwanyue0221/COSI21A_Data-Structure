	 * More complex methods should have their own test cases, sometimes even more than one. 
	 * Here we have two additional test cases, to test the speak() and toString() methods. 
	 * The speak() method is more complex than a getter, so you should have more than one 
	 * assertion in the test case. Minimally you should test speak() for a child and an adult. 
	 * 
	 * In future assignments you might even have more than one test case per method. Let's say 
	 * you're implementing a List and you want to test the insert() method that you wrote. You 
	 * might have testInsertAtFront, testInsertInMiddle, and testInsertAtEnd test cases. 
	 * 
	 * You should name your test cases in an informative way. The more informative your names 
	 * are and the more modular your test cases are, the easier it will be for you to use 
	 * them to debug your code. 
	 * 
	 * Remember, JUnit tests are always required, and it is in your best interest to write 
	 * thorough, comprehensive tests. The better your tests are the more likely you are to 
	 * pass the grading tests.
